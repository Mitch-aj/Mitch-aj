		<p style="color: white;">A condominium, called “condo” for short, is a privately-owned individual unit within a community of other units. Condo owners jointly own shared common areas, such as pools, garages, elevators and outside hallways and gyms, to name a few. While some condos are found in high-rise buildings, you can find detached condos in some markets. In general, the owner typically owns the interior of the condo and the structural components of exterior walls.</p>
